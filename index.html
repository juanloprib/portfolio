                        <p>Hey there, I'm Juan David Lopera, a full-stack developer from the vibrant city of Bogota, Colombia. I'm excited to share with you a glimpse of my world, where every project I've had the privilege to work on is a unique and fascinating planet. That's why I've designed this website to revolve around this cosmic metaphor, where each project is a satellite orbiting my planet, waiting to be explored.</p>
                        <p>My journey to become a developer was a unique one. I have a bachelor's degree in music and sound engineering (<a href="https://www.javeriana.edu.co/" target="_blank">Javeriana University</a>), and while studying there, I discovered my love for programming. I found that coding allowed me to express my creativity in a new and exciting way. In fact, my thesis project was focused on Java programming and audio programming, and I was honored to receive an honorable mention for it.</p>
                        <p>After graduating, I continued learning about web development on my own (backend and frontend). I've been an entrepreneur for many years. As an innovative full-stack developer, I bring a diverse skill set to the table, including programming, design, and online marketing. My experience as a creative entrepreneur has given me an extensive background in web, branding, and social media, and my foundation in sound engineering and music makes me a well-rounded and versatile developer.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, I've led teams that have successfully delivered brands, websites, and complex apps. I'm proud to say that I've made many friends along the way, and I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate with future friends.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not working, you can find me spending time with my family - my amazing girlfriend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/doctorblog" target="_blank">Adriana, who is a doctor</a>, our loyal labradoodle "Tomate", who is undoubtedly the best dog on earth, and our beautiful daughter <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@draleche" target="_blank">"Manu"</a>. They may keep me up at night, but I wouldn't trade a single moment with them for anything. They are my world, and I love them with all of my heart. They are my constant reminder of what truly matters in life, and they inspire me to work hard every day to create a better future for us all.</p>
