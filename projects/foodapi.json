        "And to show off my skills, I went all out and implemented an MVC architecture to keep the code clean and organized. The best part is that the <a href='https://github.com/juanloprib/recipes-search-save' target='_blank'>code is public on my GitHub page</a>, so check it out and let me know what you think!",
